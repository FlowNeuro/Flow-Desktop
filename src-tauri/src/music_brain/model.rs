//! The dedicated, entity-based music taste model.
//!
//! This is deliberately **separate** from `flow_neuro`'s `UserBrain`. Music is an
//! entity-centric, repeat-dominated problem; modelling it as the video engine's
//! bag-of-title-tokens vector is a category error (see
//! `notes/music/music_recommendation_analysis.md`). The primitives here are
//! artists, tracks, and genres — never free-text title tokens.
